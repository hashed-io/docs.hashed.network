Hashed Network is a parachain for businesses [a]. 

It's a hub[b] for digitally-native organizations[c] and blockchain-powered[d] products and services[e] for those organizations[f].

Rooted in sovereignty[g], the network provides a glide path[h] for traditional businesses and nonprofits to adopt the benefits of web3[h], digitalness[i], and decentralization[j].

---------

[a] organizations, non-profits, coops, or any scenario where multiple people manage resources for common goals. 
[b] `hub` implies it is a center of activity for businesses to provide services and business subscribers.
[c] `digitally-native organizations` is a forward-looking declaration; a high-confidence aspiration. The network isn't only for these organizations; regular businesses can and will be connected to Hashed Network of course, but we believe the all organizations will be born digitally in the future. The `native` word means that the organization is born on chain, that the 'system of record' for that organization is on-chain, and transactions are final settlement. It also connects to *Native Bitcoin Vaults* language, which I think is helpful. I think we can use this langauge without a perception that it is ONLY for DNOs.  
[d] I don't love this
[e] It's not for us to decide if something is a product or service, so maybe we can change this to something broader.
[f] Seems like we shouldn't this noun in the same sentence twice

[g] the importance of **sovereignty** is paramount, but it may be repetitive and the sentence structure is weird. The idea is very similar to [c]; it's a point of emphasis on this sentence because it serves in contrast to the idea of "glide path for traditional businesses". Some critics of the project may criticize integrating with legacy institutions, banks, etc; in that, it is distraction from projects aiming for more transformative changes over a longer time horizon. This is a balance we need to find. 

In our materials, we refer to the fiat/banking-integration features as "back-bridges". Meaning "we are here and moving, but you can use backwards-looking, compatibility-adapters to gain connection."  Other back-bridges are sign-via-email, Docusign, etc. 

[g] maybe change "glide path" to "soft landing"

[h] I don't want to use "web3", but what is a better word? It used to be called "dapps"

[i] References back to the articles

[j] don't love this word choice either. Maybe we should calls it all "digitalness".
