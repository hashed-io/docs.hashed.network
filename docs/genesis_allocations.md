*The purpose of HASH is to proactively and automatically manage the health of the network through programmatic incentives.*

Genesis allocations were derived using a 3-step process from an analysis of the Polkadot parachains listed on [parachains.info](https://parachains.info).

1. Data collection - recorded the genesis allocations for each parachain and candidate (n=170)
2. Data cleansing - labels used for the allocations (pie charts) are inconsistent across chains, so we mapped each of the allocations into a consistent structure (as defined below)
3. Aggregate and score - with a clean data set, we were able to aggregate all parachains into a consistent score for each allocation category.

### Allocation Categories
 |Category|Subcategory|Definition|
    |---|---|---|
    |Founding Team|
    ||Founding Team|Individuals/companies responsible for establishing and executing the Network vision since conception|
    |Investors|
    ||Seed Round|Initial round of fundraising|
    ||Subsequent Round|Second and subsequent round(s) of fundraising|
    |Budgets|
    ||Community|Funds allocated to engage and support general token holders and ambassadors (“fans”)|
    ||Ecosystem|Funds allocated to support applications and organizations using Hashed Network (“users”)|
    ||Marketing|Funds allocated to drive awareness of the benefits and features of the Hashed Network|
    ||Development|Funds allocated to continue building the base protocol, pallets, and network services|
    |Parachain|
    ||Crowdloan|Rewards paid to accounts that contribute to a crowdloan resulting in a successful parachain lease, not limited to the any specific crowdloan|
    ||Auctions|Funds allocated to directly swap or stake for a parachain slot, not limited to any specific auction|
    |Reserve|
    ||Reserve|Funds with no specific allocation, such as *treasury* or *reserve*|
    
### Prototypical Genesis Allocations
The following pie chart shows a prototypical genesis allocation of other parachains and parachain candidates (data as of Nov 2022). Hashed Network uses this allocation as the starting point and applies changes as necessary via governance.
