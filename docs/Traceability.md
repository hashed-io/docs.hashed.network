## Traceability

Traceability is a clear use case of blockchain. With this in mind, Hashed Network has been working with Peruâ€™s Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Production for the last couple of years on a blockchain traceability initiative for their cacao and coffee producers. 

Hashed (previously Digital Scarcity & Mighty Wizards Partnership) have signed LOI with the Ministry of Production of Peru and the National Cooperative Business Association and are currently participating in an RFP.
