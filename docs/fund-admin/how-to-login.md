## **Introduction**
Before to start, you must have:
- A Polkadot account
- The Polkadot extension installed on your browser
- Your Polkadot account connected to the Polkadot extension
- An administrator from the Fund Administration website has added you to the list of users

All the steps to create and
connect your Polkadot account to the Polkadot extension are explained in this [guide](./polkadot-account.md#introduction).

**Note**: The first time you enter to the `Fund Administration` website, you may be asked to `Authorize` the Polkadot extension. You can do it by clicking on the `Yes, allow this application access` button.
