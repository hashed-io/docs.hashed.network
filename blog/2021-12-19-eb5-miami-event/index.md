We are the Crown Sponsor of the [2023 EB-5 & Global Immigration Expo](https://www.eb5investors.com/conferences/eb5-immigration-expo-miami-united-states). The long standing event attracts hundreds of professionals from the bullseye of our targeted user. Some of them are already users. 

The platform's name is "EB5 Proxy" and the subline is "powered by Hashed Network, a Polkadot parachain". Polkadot's logo will show in the booth signage and edited videos. 

We seek funding to record footage from the event, including the talks and fireside chats, where I explain much about our platform, and a bit about how it uses Hashed Network and Polkadot. 

The audience is not a typical crypto conference audience. There will be attorneys, accountants, fund administrators, and broker dealers. This audience provides a strong halo effect to the Polkadot brand because the audience is seeing the brand in their own habitat. 

We will produce and record "man on the street" style interviews throughout the event. 

The high fidelity editing will produce 3 polished videos, each with customized content that puts an emphasis on a particular layer. One for Polkadot, one for Hashed Network, and one for the dapp, EB5 Proxy. The raw footage will be shared publicly for others to use.

The booth will look like this one. (It is just a coincidence that logo looks like the Polkadot logo)
