        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>There are 3 key features of Native Bitcoin Vaults. </p><ol><li>Flexible policy engine for managing bitcoin with business rules<ul><li>Uses Partially-Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) to roll-up bitcoin spending proposals and approvals</li><li>Orchestrated by Substrate, integrated with bitcoin via off-chain workers</li><li>Bitcoin signing compatible with many convenient signers, from highly secured airgapped signers to not-very-secure 'Sign with Google' for the web3 experimenter.</li></ul></li><li>Verifiable receiving addresses<ul><li>Bitcoin senders can independently verify a receiving address for a specific vault, such as an elected council based on the democracy pallet. </li><li>Generate a new receiving address for each UTXO</li></ul></li><li>Integration with other Hashed Network features <ul><li>Triple entry accounting platform allows businesses to natively assign bitcoin sends and receipts to General Ledger accounts such as Income and Expenses.</li><li>Integration with Confidential Documents, which allows users to securely encrypt, save, and share data that corresponds to a vault or journal entries. </li></ul></li></ol><p>There are 3 key 'reasons to believe' NBV is useful. </p><ol><li>More businesses are adopting bitcoin on their balance sheet. </li><li>NBV is real, simple, pure bitcoin.

However, it is more privacy-preserving to generate a new receiving address for every transaction, which has become the norm now. Each receiving address is transformed into a UTXO as soon as it receives a payment. </p><p>Each UTXO has a pre-determined, Substrate-orchestrated configuration for set of potential signers and threshold. This creates a lot of flexibility for use cases such as budgeting funds to sub-groups or task forces, paying invoices based on requested drawdowns, and using higher security signers for larger UTXOs.</p><p>To spend the UTXO, Substrate compiles the Paritally Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) together, and when ready, broadcasts it to the Bitcoin network. PSBTs were introduced in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIP-174</a> and are implemented in many wallets including Bitcoin Core. NBV also uses output descriptors extensively, which is also a broadly supported standard for describing UTXOs in a composable fashion.</p><p>Using standards like these means that there are many available signers, such as ColdCard, BlueWallet, or libraries such as <a href="https://bitcoindevkit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin Dev Kit</a>. Users can also sign with a key stored in Confidential Documents (sign via polkadot.js), our own Hashed Wallet, or even 'Sign with Google' for the web3 experimenter or casual user.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="verifiable-receiving-addresses">Verifiable Receiving Addresses<a class="hash-link" href="#verifiable-receiving-addresses" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There are two primary attacks as it relates to bitcoin. Either a hacker finds your secret, or the sender is tricked into sending bitcoin to an address for which the hacker has the secret. NBV addresses the latter. </p><p>The generated receiving addresses can be cryptographically verified by senders from other vaults or senders using any compatible bitcoin wallet. For example, if a set of treasurers were elected using the <code>democracy</code> pallet, they could begin receiving contributions immediately and seamlessly rather than the worrisome trouble of having them coordinate together separately to generate receiving addresses. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="integration-with-hashed-network-features">Integration with Hashed Network Features<a class="hash-link" href="#integration-with-hashed-network-features" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Verifiability is secure. However, some bitcoin vaults wish to remain private. NBV supports integration with Confidential Documents, which allows users to safely encrypt and share data such as the output descriptors, wallet metadata, receiving addresses, and vault documents. </p><p>NBV also integrates with the triple-entry accounting tools on Hashed Network. This platform allows businesses to natively assign bitcoin sends and receipts to General Ledger accounts such as Assets and Expenses, enabling Income Statements and Balance Sheets.</p><h1>Reasons to believe</h1><p>Most bitcoin layers that I've seen on programmable blockchains, such as Ethereum and Polkadot, have an element of custody/trust, peg tokens, or collateral backing. They are usually engineered by people much smarter than me, and I'm not qualified to opine on how secure they are. </p><p>I think people want real bitcoin though. Real, simple, pure bitcoin. Especially for large amounts often seen in business treasuries or managed by governance teams.</p><p>In 2021, companies such as Tesla and Microstrategy adopted bitcoin as a treasury asset, many of which described in this <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-bitcoin-boom-the-future-of-the-company-balance-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cointelegraph article</a>. We believe this trend will continue and accelerate in the coming years. </p><p>Valuations for companies such as Fireblocks, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fireblocks-raises-550-million-in-series-e-funding-to-become-the-highest-valued-digital-asset-infrastructure-provider-301469630.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which raised $550 million on a valuation of $8 billion</a>, suggest that there is a market for payment approval, coordination, and broadcast.</p><div style="text-align:center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kn_eqC07wao" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div><h1>Road Map</h1><p>There are 3 key focus areas on the road map: </p><ol><li>Short term focus is usability for basic treasury activities </li><li>Migrate from off-chain worker BDK-integration to WASM</li><li>Integrate additional signers</li></ol>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The American colonies claimed independence in order to maintain the status quo. To stay consistent to the way it always had been. It was the British who were defying precedence by using new mental gymnastics to derive new rights of the Sovereign over free Englishman. </p><p>In 1765, William Blackstone wrote, in <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30802/30802-h/30802-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commentaries on the Laws of England</a>, wrote that sovereignty was indivisible. Of governments, he wrote  "<!-- -->[h]<!-- -->owever they began, or by what right soever they subsist, there is and must be in all of them a supreme, irresistible, absolute, uncontrolled authority, in which the jura summi imperii, or the rights of sovereignty, reside" and that "it can do everything that is not naturally possible."</p><p>Blackstone’s analysis was used to justify British Parliament’s passage of the Stamp Act, the legislative impetus that kindled American independence. From Ellis:</p><blockquote><p>The inherently absolute doctrine of sovereignty that Blackstone proposed to Parliament was the very same claim to unrestricted, nonnegotiable authority that medieval monarchs has been claiming for several centuries and that the entire Whig tradition in English history… had rejected as a tyrannical vestige of feudalism. </p><p>In that sense the sovereignty principle as Blackstone defined it effectively provided Parliament with a secular version of unquestioned power previously reserved for kings claiming divine right and popes claiming infallibility.</p></blockquote><p>Americans disagreed with Blackstone.</p><p>In the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was clear to emphasize that the truths are self-evident, meaning they are known as true without proof, that they come from Nature or God and are not granted by a state or monarch. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Independence" src="/assets/images/independence-52e25a0b8a6aca02a012d1fcb118eec5.png" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Madison’s <a href="https://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/founders/default.xqy?keys=FOEA-print-02-02-02-3188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Essay on Sovereignty</a> opens with "<!-- -->[i]<!-- -->t has hitherto been understood, that the supreme power, that is, the sovereignty of the people of the States, was in its nature divisible; and was in fact divided". </p><p>As we frame how web3 and self-sovereignty is regulated by states, we should adhere to the same principle that sovereignty is divisible. Our Founders never intended for the state to have the control that it currently enjoys, such as control over financial censorship, ability to interject into commercial contracts, and surveil private information. It is states that are transforming, not the self-evident truths. </p><p>In the years between our founding and now, there was no specific moment or action by the state where good intentions became abuse of power. There are no villains in this story. Yet, the invention of digital scarcity, by Satoshi Nakomato in 2008, obsoletes the need for and will unravel dependence on power structures that have been centuries in the making.</p><p>Web 1 (digital publishing) and Web 2 (digital interaction) disrupted industries in their corresponding adoption phases, and we are still living in the midst of the latter. The scale of disruption ahead from Web 3 transformation will tower above its predecessors. </p><p>On May 28, 1775, the Second Continental Congress adopted a two-pronged strategy. </p><p>One prong was <a href="https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/olive-branch-petition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Olive Branch Petition</a>. This petition was a request to the King to avoid a war between the colonies and Great Britain. The Congress asked, </p><blockquote><p>[T]<!-- -->hat your Majesty be pleased to direct some mode, by which the united applications of your faithful colonists to the throne, in pursuance of their common councils, may be improved into a happy and permanent reconciliation;…</p><p>That your Majesty may enjoy a long and prosperous reign, and that your descendants may govern your dominions with honor to them selves and happiness to their subjects, is our sincere and fervent prayer. </p></blockquote><p>The current environment bare similarities to that time. Embracing Wyoming’s statutes for blockchain-powered businesses, these tools and integrations make it easy for entrepreneurs to establish, fund, coordinate, and govern fully on-chain businesses. Final settlement of assets occurs digitally and self-custody is cryptographically tamper-proof.</p><p>Registering a business or a <a href="https://digiday.com/media/wtf-is-a-dao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAO</a> as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLC</a> is certainly not required to use Hashed Network. The integration, one of many, automates the steps of establishing a <a href="https://hashed.io/digitalness-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compliant DAO LLC in Wyoming</a>. </p><hr><p>The layer one (L1) blockchain, a Polkadot parachain, is public and permissionless. It supports “bring your own regulation” functionality for common administrative activities such as organizational charters, capital formation and administration, self-custody treasury, and more.  In its opening act, open source developers partnered with legislators to implement support for business registrations on-chain in a manner that matches the spirit and letter of the legislation.</p><p>An example of one of the libraries, or pallets, is Moderated Marketplaces. One of the great promises of web3 is censorship-resistance and disintermediation. However, more common than pure anarchy, are marketplaces where participants desire some controls or moderation. Buyers and sellers may desire an escrow service, an intermediary or someone with reputation at stake, or a promise that everyone in a specific marketplace has been vetted by a trusted moderator. Precedent for these practices span throughout history from Babylon to Quanzhou to Laguna Beach. </p><p>The moderator is typically paid a commission on the economic value of the trade in their marketplaces. The Network immediately converts 10% of the commission amount to HASH tokens and burns them. The purpose of this burn is to reduce the overall supply in a manner roughly equivalent to the cost of operating the Network and incubating network effects.</p><p>The burn is native to the L1 and broadly implemented, configured at genesis to a value of 10% across all marketplaces. It may be set to 0% or otherwise via governance, which may also upgrade the runtime to alter functionality.</p><p>The HASH token is also used to cover fees derived from the weight of transactions, which is a function of physical disk and compute requirements for a transaction. There are community and commercially available options for sponsoring permissioned faucets.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Web3 Wheel" src="/assets/images/web3-wheel-18e9cb3dda3a913b8206689a83c52eb1.png" width="836" height="750" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For the Network to maintain economic viability, the burn must always remain less than the a) cost to fork minus the b) value of the network effects. If the burn encroaches on that amount, Marketplaces should fork, perhaps using the same software on another network or even one they self-host. The game theory should drive the burn towards zero with scale. Most interestingly, the game theory holds the Network accountable to not just building valid blocks, but generating actual economic network effects for users. Long-term viable networks must seek elimination of all rent seeking.</p><hr><p>Hashed Network does not seek a reputation or brand as ‘the regulated’ or ‘the compliant’ blockchain. These are simply features that businesses, dapps, and marketplace administrators have available.</p><p>The DAO LLC creator wizard, compliance tools, and banking integrations are representative of the Network’s metaphorical Olive Branch Petition.</p><p>After adopting The Olive Branch Petition, the Second Continental Congress did not idly stand by to await response from the King. On the next day, the 6th of July, the Congress adopted the <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-01-02-0113-0005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms</a>. This was the resolution to prepare for war. It summoned twenty thousand troops with George Washington at the helm.</p><p>So inspired, Hashed Network is a public, decentralized, permission-less parachain to be secured by the Polkadot relay chain. At the base layer, it is a digital demilitarized zone (DMZ) for business and commerce.  </p><hr><p>Like the Founders, I reject the notion that sovereignty is indivisible. Ellis, again, of the time: </p><blockquote><p>A new and thoroughly modern idea was entering the political conversation at this moment, the idea of multiple or shared sovereignties. Franklin had glimpsed it much earlier, and had devoted much of this time in London trying to make members of the British government embrace it. And once they did, the intractable argument over Parliament’s authority became easily negotiable, because sharing authority with the colonial legislatures became possible.</p></blockquote><hr><p>Hashed Network is Independent per the following necessary and sufficient conditions.</p><ol><li>The software that operates the Network is open source and publicly available.</li><li>The chain data is deterministic and necessarily publicly available.</li><li>Node operators may perform duties pursuant to Network sovereignty.</li><li>If Network sovereignty is in conflict with state or other sovereign claims, Network sovereignty takes precedence.</li></ol><hr><p>The Tenth Amendment states that "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."</p><p>Digital scarcity, as a technology, or web3, as a suite of tools, simultaneously requires and establishes censorship resistance across a global digital landscape. It's required because each node must sync the same chain and it's established because users can easily swap to another node. These layers, like TCP/IP, seeks little benefit from geographical borders. </p><p>The nature of the technology necessitates that the powers are "not delegated to" the federal system or the state system. L1 node operators and L1 protocol developers are performing work at the will of the Network, and they must have independence for the L1 blockchain to operate correctly. The protocol software is very low in the stack, where, like TCP/IP, the technology does not have relationships with or even awareness of users.</p><p>Inasmuch, The <b>Bill of Rights for L1 Node Operators and Developers</b>:</p><ul><li>L1 node operators must not be expected or required to censor or manipulate transactions. </li><li>L1 node operators must not be expected or required to check or maintain records that cross-reference transactions to real world persons, businesses, teams, or places. </li><li>L1 node operators must not be expected or required to provide information to any party that is otherwise publicly available on-chain or in documentation materials. </li><li>L1 developers must be free and independent to author the protocol desired by the L1 network without constraint or limitation. </li></ul><div style="text-align:center"><p><img loading="lazy" alt="image" src="/assets/images/node-operator-aaa58a99e774d6836a1a061cfd6f8709.png" width="526" height="513" class="img_ev3q"></p></div><p>[1]<!-- --> Ellis, Joseph.
